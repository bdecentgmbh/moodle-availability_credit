Credit Availability Condition for Moodle
----------------------------------------

With this plugin, you can put a price on any course content and ask for a Credit payment to allow access. It works only with "course modules and resources". The support to "course sections" or "topics" is not yet implemented.

Usage
-----

This works like the [Credit enrol plugin](https://docs.moodle.org/310/en/CreditEnrolment), but instead of restricting the full course, you can restrict individual activities, resources or sections (and you can combine it with other availability conditions, for example, to exclude some group from paying using an "or" restriction set).
